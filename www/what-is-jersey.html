    <h1>What is Jersey?</h1>
    <p>Jersey is not an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey">island</a> off the north coast of Normandy, France. Nor is it (despite the logo) a soft, plain-knitted fabric used for clothing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_jersey">cyclists</a>.</p>
    <p>Jersey is the open source JAX-RS (JSR 311) Reference Implementation for building RESTful Web services. But, it is also more than the Reference Implementation. Jersey provides additional APIs and extension points (SPIs) so that developers may extend Jersey to suite their needs.</p>
    <h1>Status</h1>
    <p>Jersey is currently available as an early access implementation. Jersey cannot go to version 1.0 until JAX-RS reaches the final release and is an approved JSR. Until that point Jersey will track the JSR 311 API and will regularly update according to 311 Expert Group agreed snapshots of the API. This will give an opportunity for users, developers and expert group members to play with and test the 311 API with the important goal in mind of receiving invaluable feedback on the quality of the API as it progresses.
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <ul>
	<li>Track the 311 API and provide regular early access Reference Implementations;</li>
	<li>Develop a production quality Reference Implementation;</li>
	<li>Provide APIs and extension points (SPIs) to extend Jersey;</li>
	<li>Build a community of users and developers;</li>
	<li>Ship with Glassfish; and finally</li>
	<li>Make it easy to build RESTful Web services utilising Java and the Java Virtual Machine.</li>
    </ul>
