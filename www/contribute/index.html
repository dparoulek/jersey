    <h1>How to Contribute?</h1>
    <p>There are many ways to contribute, the following are some suggestions:</p>
    <ul>
	<li><a href="http://jersey.java.net/nonav/documentation/latest/user-guide.html#chapter_deps">Download</a> Jersey, have a play, then <a href="/communicate/">communicate</a>: what what you liked, disliked; what worked for you, what did not; ask questions on how to implement use-cases.</li>
	<li>Suggest and/or provide more examples.</li>
	<li>Report bugs to the <a href="http://java.net/projects/jersey/lists/users/">users</a> list or via <a href="http://java.net/jira/browse/JERSEY">issue tracker</a> (preferably the later).
        <li>Provide patches to fix bugs, preferably with unit tests.</li>
        <li>Improve existing unit tests or provide new unit tests.</li>
	<li>Propose new features.</li>
	<li>Improve documentation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Jersey is under the <a href="http://jersey.java.net/CDDL+GPL.html">CDDL+GPL license</a>.</p>
    <p>Commit access (the developer role) will be given on a meritorious basis based, in part, on a developers experience of and previous contributions to the project (a fair process adopted by many open source projects).</p>
    <p>It is recommend that developers wishing to contribute some code first submit a patch so that the project developers may review it before accepting and committing the patch.</p>
    <p>The first step to contributing a patch (or to becoming a developer) is to complete and return <a href="http://oss.oracle.com/oca.pdf">Oracle Community Agreement (OCA)</a>. The completed form may be sent by email to to <a href="mailto:sun_ca@sun.com">oracle-ca_us@oracle.com</a>.</p>
    <p>The OCA (see <a href="http://oss.oracle.com/oca-faq.pdf">detailed OCA FAQ here</a>) gives Oracle and the contributor joint copyright interests in the code. The contributor retains copyrights while also granting those rights to Oracle as the project sponsor. You only need to sign the OCA once in order to cover all changes that you might contribute to any Oracle-sponsored open-source project including not just the Jersey project but also, for example, <a href="http://glassfish.java.net/">GlassFish</a> and <a href="http://metro.java.net/">Metro</a>.</p>
