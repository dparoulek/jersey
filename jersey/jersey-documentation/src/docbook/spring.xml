    <title>Jersey With Spring</title>
    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>This chapter explains how to get started with a simple project that utilizes Jersey
            with <ulink url="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</ulink>. At the end of this
            chapter, the reader will be able to configure Jersey inside the Spring framework and
            take advantage of some Spring specific features available in Jersey. The intended
            audience of this chapter is developers already familiar with Spring who are interested
            in using Jersey in their applications.</para>
        <para>The easiest way to explain how to use Jersey with Spring is via an example. Rather
            than creating a Spring application from scratch, we will start with a Web application
            generated from a Maven archetype and then modify it to run inside Spring.</para>
        <note>
            <para>Should we cite a version of spring here?</para>
        </note>

    <section>
        <title>Creating a Web Application</title>
        <para>In this section we shall create a simple Web application using one of Jersey's <ulink
                url="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</ulink> archetypes. Most development
            environments support Maven and Maven archetypes, but to avoid narrowing this discussion
            to any specific development envinroment, we shall use command-line tools instead. To
            create the basic Web application execute the following command:
            <programlisting>mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=http://maven.java.net/</programlisting>
            and select the <literal>jersey-quickstart-webapp</literal> option. When prompted choose
                <literal>example.jersey.spring</literal> for the <literal>groupId</literal> and
            choose <literal>example-spring-jersey</literal> for the <literal>artifactId</literal>.
            For all other options choose the default values.</para>
        <para>Once the Web application has been generated, it is a good idea to test it to make
            sure that it is properly configured. For example, using <ulink url="http://glassfish.java.net">Glassfish</ulink>
            listening to port 8080,
            we can compile and test the application in the <literal>example-spring-jersey</literal>
            directory as shown below:
            <programlisting linenumbering="numbered">mvn clean install
asadmin deploy target/example-spring-jersey.war
curl -v http://localhost:8080/example-spring-jersey/webresources/myresource</programlisting>
            If everything works, the last line printed by the <literal>curl</literal> command should be 
            <literal>Hi there!</literal> (if the <literal>curl</literal> command is not available
            on your system, you can try pointing to the URL using your system's browser).
