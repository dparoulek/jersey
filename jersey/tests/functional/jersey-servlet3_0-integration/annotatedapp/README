Tests that a web application which has an javax.ws.rs.core.Application sub-class annotated with @javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath, and no servlets defined in the web.xml works fine after the Jersey Servlet 3.0 integration.

Ex:
import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/oneonly")
public class OneApplication extends Application {
 ....

}
